## Project Objective ðŸŽ¯

This project helps us gain experience in file handling, memory management, and thread programming. Additionally, we learn how to efficiently use static memory space, interact with files, and manage input/output operations in this project.

## Use Cases ðŸ“‹

The get_next_line function reads a line from a file and can be called multiple times. Use cases may include:

- Reading a file line by line: `get_next_line(fd, &line);`
- Reading from multiple files simultaneously: `get_next_line(fd1, &line1); get_next_line(fd2, &line2);`
